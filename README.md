Hello! This is a Java game I made in High School for my AP Computer Science course. It uses a depth-first search algorithm to generate a random maze each time you play
and you must find your way to the bottom-right corner, starting in the top-left. The "twist" is that the entire grid is actually dark and you must blindly find your way
through.

The original plan was to add enemies and other functionality, but I never got around to it. My current plan is to recreate this using C# and the .NET Framework and flesh
it out.

Note: The files in this repo are not actually the final version of the game. I am searching for it and will update once I find it.
